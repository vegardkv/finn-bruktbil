Hello Codex

Introduced a prompt and iterate a bit to get the current setup. Seems to work very well, except that ads are not parsed correctly, and the data base table only focuses on a subset of data. This should be easy to fix with further iteration.

Next step: make sure when downloading data, that (1) the data is fetched correctly, and (2) the data base table is created and updated correctly. May need some database deletion/resetting script
